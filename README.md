Data Science is a big domain. Today's job roles require me to be expert on multiple disciplines from business understanding, data modelling, deployment to scaling application/service to millions of users. Getting experience in all of them requires time and learning. Learning in a scattered way feels useless and prioritization is difficult. This is an experimentation on myself to look at future requirements of world and prepare myself accordingly.
